CSS practice with a mug inspiration

Story: Long time ago I was crush by a mug. Are very simple mug, but they are long (I'm a thirsty person and I love drink on larger cups), but that mugs was awesome! I realy loved they quotes. When I started to learn to talk in english last year (Aug 2019), my aunts give to me that both mugs... Well, one of them was my inspiration for this page.

I practice CSS coping the mug style and quotes. It's simple but I love it!
